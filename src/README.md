BrainStation Software Engineering Bootcamp - Capstone Project

## Overview

Your ultimate companion for sustainable living. Discover nearby community gardens, zero-waste shops and thrift stores with our interactive map. Stay informed and spread awareness on upcoming volunteering opportunities, protests and other green events. Turn over a new leaf for a greener tomorrow.

### Problem

The existential climate crisis is overwhelming. This app aims to make sustainable living more accessible, convenient and aims to raise awareness by bringing community together.

### User Profile

Those interested in living more sustainably looking for shops & resources near them or near a certain location. Individuals wanting to discover community events.

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to find the closest community garden(s), thrift store(s), and/or zero-waste grocery store(s) to a location
- As a user I want to be able to find events near me

## To Run

You will need a Google Maps API Key:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key

and to create a MapID:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id
(default Raster, I called my map newleaf)

client .env sample:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID=your_map_id
VITE_CORS_ORIGIN = http://localhost:8080
```

server .env sample:

```
CORS_ORIGIN = http://localhost:5173
PORT=8080

DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=new_leaf
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

- server: npm i, npx knex migrate:latest, npx knex seed:run, node server.js,
- client: npm i , npm run dev
